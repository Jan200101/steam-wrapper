# steam-wrapper
a thrown together project
it finds all executable files in a directory
lists them
and executes the one you press on
created to make running game mods easier for me

## How does it work?
it makes a list of all executable files (or just .exes on Windows)
makes a button for each of them
and pressing the button replaces the wrapper with the executable
preserving arguments and so on

If a button does nothing that means the file is marked as executable but isn't a binary
